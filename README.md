Intrusion detection is the process of monitoring the events occurring in your network and analyzing them for signs of possible incidents, violations, or imminent threats to your security policies. Intrusion prevention is the process of performing intrusion detection and then stopping the detected incidents. These security measures are available as intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS), which become part of your network to detect and stop potential incidents.
